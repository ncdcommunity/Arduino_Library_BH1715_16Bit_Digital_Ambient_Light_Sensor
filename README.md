How to Use the BH1715 Arduino Library
The BH1715 has a number of settings, which can be configured based on user requirements.

1.Resolution Mode:The following command is used to set the mode of resolution and measure Ambient light.

          bh.setResMode(CONTINOUS_HIGH);          // Measure Ambient Light, Continous High Resolution Mode
          
2.Resolution per count:The following command is used to set the resolution value per count. 

           bh.setResolution(RESOLUTION_DEFAULT);   // MTreg value: 0100_0101 (MTreg: 69), lx / count: 0.83
